## Method
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method uses a game theoretic approach that measures each player's contribution to the final outcome by assigning an importance value that represents its contribution.

## Resources
- [shap-jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/SHAP/shap-jupyter.ipynb) trains a GBDT model on dataset for heart failure prediction, and shows summary plots and local and global interpretations computed by TreeSHAP.
- [shap-nn-jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/SHAP/shapp-nn-jupyter.ipynb) trains an MLP on for default prediction, and provides explanation and summary plots computed by Kernel Explainer SHAP method.
