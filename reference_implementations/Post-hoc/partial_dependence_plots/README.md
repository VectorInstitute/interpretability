## Method
Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) shows the marginal effect a feature has on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model by marginalizing the model output over a feature distribution subset. 

## Resources
- [PDP-jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/partial_dependence_plots/PDP-jupyter.ipynb) computes PDPs and explains predictions of Linear regression and Gradient boosting regressor models for house price prediction.

## Datasets
- [California housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html)
