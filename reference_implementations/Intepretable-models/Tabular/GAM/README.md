## Introduction
Interpretable machine learning is crucial for understanding and trusting model predictions. This notebook focuses on Generalized Additive Models (GAM), a powerful method for creating interpretable models for tabular data.

## What is a GAM?
A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is a type of statistical model that combines the properties of generalized linear models with additive models. It allows for flexible, non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables while maintaining interpretability.

## Why Use GAMs?
- **Interpretability**: GAMs provide clear insights into how each feature affects the prediction.
- **Flexibility**: They can model non-linear relationships without losing interpretability.
- **Transparency**: Easy to visualize and understand the contribution of each feature.
