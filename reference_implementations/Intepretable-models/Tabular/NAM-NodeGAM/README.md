# NODE-GAM

NodeGAM is another neural-based GAM that improves from NAM in 2 ways: (1) it uses differentiable trees which allow quick, non-linear changes, (2) it uses attention to do feature selection that can scale to a large number of features, and (3) model pairwise feature interactions called NodeGA2M.
