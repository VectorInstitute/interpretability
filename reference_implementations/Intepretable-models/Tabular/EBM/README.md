# Interpretable Models: Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) on tabular data.

## Contents

- `EBM-jupyter.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step guide on how to use EBM for interpreting tabular data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the EBM demonstration, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interpretability-bootcamp.git
    cd interpretability-bootcamp/reference_implementations/Interpretable-models/Tabular/EBM
    ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the `EBM-jupyter.ipynb` notebook to follow along with the demonstration.

## Notebook Overview

The `EBM-jupyter.ipynb` notebook covers the following:

- **Introduction to EBM**: An overview of Explainable Boosting Machine and its importance in model interpretability.
- **Data Preparation**: Steps to load and preprocess the tabular data.
- **Model Training**: Instructions on how to train an EBM model on the prepared data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate the performance of the EBM model.
- **Interpretability**: Methods to interpret the results and understand the model's predictions.
