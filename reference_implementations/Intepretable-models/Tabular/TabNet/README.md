## Method
TabNet is an interpretable  deep learning architecture that uses sequential attention to choose which features to reason
from at each decision step, enabling efficient learning as the learning capacity is used for the most salient features.

## Resources
[TabNet](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Intepretable-models/Tabular/TabNet/TabNet.ipynb) notebook contains example of Tabnet classifier on diabetic dataset, along with Global and local explainability.
