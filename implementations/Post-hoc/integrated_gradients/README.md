## Method
Integrated Gradients (IG): This method aims to attribute an importance value to each input feature of a machine learning model based on the gradients of the model output with respect to the input.

## Resources
- [ig-imaging-jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/integrated_gradients/ig-imaging-jupyter.ipynb): Computes integrated gradients and shows feature attributions on 2 types of images (cars and xray).
- [ig-tabular.ipynb](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/integrated_gradients/ig-tabular-jupyter.ipynb) shows local and global feature importance plots for predictions made by a Neural Network on the tabular dataset.
- [models](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/tree/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/integrated_gradients/models) contains pretrained models use din the notebooks.
- [Pleural Effusion.png](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/interpretability-bootcamp/blob/main/reference_implementations/Post-hoc/integrated_gradients/Pleural%20Effusion.png) is an example image for demonstration IG on XRay image
