# GOSDT (Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Tree)

GOSDT is a type of decision tree model designed to find the best possible decision tree while keeping it small and interpretable. It works by efficiently searching through all possible decision trees and selecting the one that gives the best balance between accuracy and simplicity (i.e., the number of splits in the tree).

This is a demonstration of GOSDT.
